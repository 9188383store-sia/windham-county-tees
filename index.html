                <p class="white">
                    We’re a small, homegrown screen-printing operation out of Windham County Connecticut primarily
                    specializing in hand screen-printed T-shirts and other garments for events, gatherings, camps,
                    and corporate staff shirts. With over 13 years of expertise in the field of small batch custom
                    screen-printing, we know what quality looks and feels like. You just can't beat a shirt that was
                    printed locally by hand with care and attention to detail.
                    <br><br>
                    With many online printing businesses, it’s easy to become just another order number and lose out on
                    the one-on-one attention that you deserve. At Windham County Tees, we make sure to spend adequate
                    time with each customer dialing in every aspect of the final product to ensure that you’ll be happy
                    and satisfied. If you’ve ever ordered screen-printed shirts before, you know that all too often, the
                    print just doesn’t last. Among many different potential quality issues, screen-printed designs peel
                    and
                    crack over time due to a misunderstanding of the curing process. With our expertise, we’ve developed
                    a
                    process that addresses these various quality issues at the heart resulting in a product that lasts.
                    <br><br>
                    Whether you already have a design you want printed, don't have a design yet and aren't sure
                    exactly what you want, or you have one but want to make changes to it before printing, we have you
                    covered! We've created logos, layouts, and designs for dozens of orders with multiple rounds of
                    review
                    to ensure you're getting exactly what you want printed. We've created designs that look great on the
                    front,
                    back, front pocket and more.
                    <br><br>
                    We have competitive pricing and would love to have your business. If you're interested in more
                    information,
                    be sure to send us an email at contact@windhamcountytees.com and we'll do our best to address any
                    concerns,
                    or questions you may have. If you have an order that you'd like to place, please fill out a quote
                    request by
                    clicking the button above and filling out the form. We'll respond promptly according to the
                    information given.

                    Windham County Tees was started in 2007 and is owned and operated by Alan Chartier. Following his
                    employment at a
                    local screen-printing business, he learned the ins and outs of professional screen-printing while
                    raising 4 children with his wife, Susan. After some time working in screen-printing, he realized he
                    could do the same
                    thing from his own backyard while having the freedom to exercise his own innate creativity and
                    passionate work ethic.
                    <br><br>
                    After leaving the company he worked for, he purchased an old-yet-dependable screen-printing press, a
                    set of
                    industry-standard screens, some buckets of ink, and a few tools before setting off to work. Through
                    the years,
                    he built himself a hand-made screen washing station and developed a high quality curing process. He
                    has designed
                    dozens of custom shirt designs for events, youth camps, restaurant staff, small businesses, and many
                    others.
                    <br><br>
                    Today, Alan continues to operate Windham County Tees as a side business out of passion for the
                    craft. The manual process,
                    with all the freedoms and avenues it provides for him to express his creativity and ingenuity is
                    something that is clearly
                    shown and proudly displayed in the work that he does.

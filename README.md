## About

Windham County Tees is a small-batch T-shirt screenprinting business in Windham, CT which is owned and operated by my Dad, Alan. I designed and built him this website for Father's Day to help him market his business.

## Technologies Used

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   A wee bit of JavaScript
-   Netlify Forms

## Problem

Windham County Tees had no web presence and needed a place to point potential customers to.

## Action

I called him and got a feel for what he wanted, quickly designed a mockup in Sketch, and developed it accordingly. I also set up netlify forms to gather submitted order quote forms from interested clients and email him the results.

## Result

He **loved** the final product, and is excited to use it as a marketing tool to build his business.
